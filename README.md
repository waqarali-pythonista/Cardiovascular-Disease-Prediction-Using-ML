# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-Using-ML ( FVP )


The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning system that can predict the risk of heart disease for patients based on their vital signs and other factors. The system will consist of three components:
A machine learning model that can classify patients into low, medium, and high risk groups based on their features such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, age, gender, etc.
A wearable device that can measure the blood pressure of the patients and send the data to the server via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
An Android application that can display the vital signs and the prediction results of the patients on their smartphones. The application will also store the data on Firebase real-time database for future analysis and monitoring.
